1 Executive Summary
This report provides a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the period
covering January 4th to March 1st, 2025, following a significant product update roll-out. The
overall user base shows healthy engagement, with a high average session length (22.5 minutes)
suggesting deep interaction. However, overall Day 7 Retention stands at 55%, indicating
a significant opportunity to optimize the new user experience. Monetization remains concentrated,
with a low Paying User Rate of 14:8% but a high ARPPU of $10:74. Most notably, the recent
A/B test of the New User Onboarding Flow (Group B) demonstrated clear success, improving
both D7 Retention and ARPU by 10 percentage points and 100%, respectively, providing a clear
path for immediate strategy implementation.
2 Engagement Metrics
Engagement remains strong, driven by long, focused sessions. The high average session length
is a positive signal for content value and product stickiness.
Metric Value Benchmark Insight
Monthly Active Users (MAU) 871 N/A Strong monthly activity.
Avg Daily Active Users (ADAU)  56 N/A Estimated average daily reach.
Stickiness (DAU/MAU) 6:4% 5 􀀀 10% Healthy, slightly above average.
Avg Session Length 22.5 minutes 15 minutes Very high engagement depth.
Avg Actions per Session 34:5 N/A Users are busy and interactive.
3 Retention & Cohorts
Overall Day 7 (D7) Retention is solid at 55%, but cohort analysis reveals modest week-over-week
fluctuations, indicating that external factors or content delivery timing might impact long-term
stickiness. The goal is to stabilize and push D7 retention towards the 60% mark.
Overall Day 7 Retention Rate
Overall D7 Retention = 55%
D7 Retention Cohort Summary
Install Cohort D7 Retention Trend
Jan 1st Week 58% High Stability
Feb 1st Week 54% Minor Dip
Feb 4th Week 57% Strong Recovery
Conclusion: Retention is robust but not consistent. The dip in the Feb 1st Week cohort requires further
investigation into user acquisition sources or in-app promotions during that period.

4 Monetization
Monetization efforts are driven by a small, high-spending user segment. The disparity between
ARPU and ARPPU highlights the need to broaden the payer base through more accessible microtransactions
or lower-tier subscription offerings.
Metric Value Insight
Total Revenue $1; 450:00 Total revenue over the period.
Paying User Rate 14:8% Low conversion; significant room for growth.
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) $1:59 Calculated across all 910 users.
ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User) $10:74 High average spend from payers.
Approximate LTV $3:53 Based on 55% D7 retention churn proxy.
Whale Analysis
The top 1% of users (9 users) generated over 40% of the total revenue, with individual spend
exceeding a $50:00 threshold. These users are highly valuable and merit personalized attention
and exclusive content offerings to maintain their engagement and spend.
5 A/B Testing: New User Onboarding (Group B)
The A/B test evaluated the impact of a revised, more interactive tutorial (Group B) compared
to the control (Group A). Group B was designed to ensure 100% tutorial completion and better
demonstrate core product value earlier. The results are decisive.
Hypothesis
Hypothesis: The new, mandatory interactive tutorial (Group B) will increase Day 7 Retention by at
least 5 percentage points and improve ARPU.
Results
Metric Control (A) Variant (B) Uplift
Day 7 Retention 50% 60% +10 pp
Avg Revenue (ARPU) $1:00 $2:00 +100%
Tutorial Completion Rate 75% 100% +25 pp
Decision
The hypothesis is confirmed with substantial positive uplift across all key metrics. The 10 pp
increase in D7 retention and 100% increase in ARPU for Group B validate the design change.
Decision: Launch Group B (New Onboarding Flow) to 100% of the user base immediately.

6 Insights & Recommendations
Key Insights
1. Onboarding is Key: The A/B test confirms that the initial experience is the single most
critical factor for D7 retention and early monetization.
2. Core Loop Value: The long session length (22.5 mins) indicates that the core product experience
is sticky and enjoyable, but many users are dropping before D7 due to initial friction
(addressed by Group B).
3. Monetization Funnel is Thin: Revenue is highly concentrated, presenting a risk. The
current product successfully converts high-intent users but fails to convert the general
user base.
Recommendations
1. Immediate Action: Global Launch of Group B. De-risk and launch the new Onboarding
Flow to all users within 24 hours. Monitor D7 retention closely for the next month to
confirm the results on a full scale.
2. Develop a Mid-Tier IAP. Introduce a low-friction, high-value purchase (e.g., ”Starter Pack”
or ”Ad-Free Access”) priced between $0:99 and $2:99. This aims to convert some of the
85:2% of non-paying users who currently enjoy the long session length but are not yet
committing to high-value transactions.
3. Deep Dive into Feb 1st Week Cohort. Investigate specific acquisition channels (country,
device, source) for the cohort that showed the lower 54% D7 retention to identify and
throttle underperforming channels.
